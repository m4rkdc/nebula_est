/*
 * Nebula Enrollment over Secure Transport - OpenAPI 3.0
 *
 * This is a simple Public Key Infrastructure Management Server based on the RFC7030 Enrollment over Secure Transport Protocol for a Nebula Mesh Network. The Service accepts requests from mutually authenticated TLS-PSK connections to create Nebula Certificates for the client, either by signing client-generated Nebula Public Keys or by generating Nebula key pairs and signing the server-generated Nebula public key and to create Nebula configuration files for the specific client. This Service acts as a Facade for the Nebula CA service (actually signign or creating the Nebula keys) and the Nebula Config service (actually creating the nebula Config. files).
